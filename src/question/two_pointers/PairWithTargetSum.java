//Solution
//Since the given array is sorted, a brute-force solution could be to iterate through the array,
//taking one number at a time and searching for the second number through Binary Search.
//The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(N*logN)O(Nâˆ—logN). Can we do better than this?
//We can follow the Two Pointers approach.
//We will start with one pointer pointing to the beginning of the array and another pointing at the end.
//At every step, we will see if the numbers pointed by the two pointers add up to the target sum.
//If they do, we have found our pair; otherwise, we will do one of two things:
//If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is greater than the target sum,
//this means that we need a pair with a smaller sum. So, to try more pairs,
//we can decrement the end-pointer.
//If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is smaller than the target sum,
//this means that we need a pair with a larger sum. So, to try more pairs,
//we can increment the start-pointer.
